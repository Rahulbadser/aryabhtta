            <h2>The Indian mathematician</h2>
            <p><b>Aryabhata or Aryabhata </b>I[4][5] (476–550 CE)[3][6] was an Indian mathematician, physicist and astronomer of the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. He lived during the Gupta period and produced works such as the Aryabhatiya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old)[7] and the Arya-siddhanta.
            Aryabhata created a system of phonemic number notation in which numbers were represented by consonant-vowel monosyllables. Later commentators such as Brahmagupta divide his work into Ganita ("Mathematics"), Kalakriya ("Calculations on Time") and Golapada ("Spherical Astronomy"). His pure mathematics discusses topics such as determination of square and cube roots, geometrical figures with their properties and mensuration, arithmetric progression problems on the shadow of the gnomon, quadratic equations, linear and indeterminate equations. Aryabhata calculated the value of pi (π) to the fourth decimal digit and was likely aware that pi (π) is an irrational number, around 1300 years before Lambert proved the same.[8] Aryabhata's sine table and his work on trignometry were extremely influential on the Islamic Golden Age; his works were translated into Arabic and influenced Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Zarqali.[9][10] In his spherical astronomy, he applied plane trigonometry to spherical geometry and gave calculations on solar, lunar eclipses. He discovered that the apparent westward motion of stars is due to the spherical Earth's rotation about its own axis. Aryabhata also noted that the luminosity of the Moon and other planets is due to reflected sunlight.[11]</p>
